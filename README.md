### Welcome to the Paid Memberships Pro - Events Integration GitHub Repository

This Add On offers integration for popular events plugins, including:

* [Events Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/)
* [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/)
* [Sugar Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sugar-calendar-lite/)
* [All-in-One Event Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/)

Events that are restricted by membership level will not allow non-members to view full event details or complete event registration. The list and single view of the event will show limited event details as defined by your Advanced Settings > "Show Excerpts to Non-Members" setting.

Additionally, you can completely hide member-restricted events to non-members via the Memberships > Advanced Settings > "Filter Searches and Archives" setting.
